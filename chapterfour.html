        <p>"We're very sorry <b>Spike</b>, we didn't know we made you nervous." they all said. "We just wanted to see you flip." "It's ok.", his <i>owner</i> smiled, "You could have told me, <b>Spike</b> gets nervous when he's surrounded by <i>strangers</i>." The <i>children</i> laughed and played with <b>Spike</b> for a while. <b>Spike</b> did a flip in excitment as the <i>children</i> awed. "<b>Spike</b> is the greatest <i>dog</i> ever!" they all screamed.</p>

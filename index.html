        <!-- First paragraph -->
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p>There was a <i>dog</i> named <b>Spike</b>. <b>Spike</b> could do many tricks which included jumping, wagging and running. Other dogs can do these tricks but there's one only <b>Spike</b> can do. <b>Spike</b> was a dog who can flip.</p>
            <br/>

        <!-- Second paragraph -->
        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
            <p>All the children gathered at <b>Spike</b> to see him flip. Spike got nervous seeing the children. "Strangers" he exclaimed, "Why are they gathered around me." Spike took a fall rather than his usual flip and ran away. "Spike!!", his owner shouted, "Where are you?" Spike's owner was a young girl who just entered elementary school. She had gotten Spike as a gift from her father when she was younger.</p>

            <p>She searched in the woods for Spike because her and Spike play near the woods. She found Spike hiding behind a bush. "Spike?", she shouted, "I miss you, please come back." Spike came out of the bush and licked his owner. "Spike, where were you?" she asked. Spike barked at her with anxiety. "I'm sorry Spike, I didn't know my friends made you scared, let's go back."</p>
            <br/>

        <!-- Last paragraph -->
        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
            <p>"We're very sorry <b>Spike</b>, we didn't know we made you nervous." they all said. "We just wanted to see you flip." "It's ok.", his <i>owner</i> smiled, "You could have told me, <b>Spike</b> gets nervous when he's surrounded by <i>strangers</i>." The <i>children</i> laughed and played with <b>Spike</b> for a while. <b>Spike</b> did a flip in excitment as the <i>children</i> awed. "<b>Spike</b> is the greatest <i>dog</i> ever!" they all screamed.</p>
